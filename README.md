# News flutter app

### This is a simple flutter application that consumes the [News API](http://newsapi.org) and brings the top headlines.

The main goal of this development was for me to experiment Flutter. This has been my first Flutter application and brings a very simple front-page displaying the current news headlines. 

**This apps includes:**

- Material design
- API Client – Chopper
- Dependency Injection Pattern – Kiwi
- Immutable Object Models & Serialization – BuiltValue
- BloC Pattern & RxDart

**Plus:**

- DialogManager for displaying dialogs.
- Handlers for Api Requests and Errors.
